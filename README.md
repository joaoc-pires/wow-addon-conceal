# Conceal

**Conceal** is a World of Warcraft addon that keeps your screen clean and focused by fading interface elements when you are not actively using them.

Instead of permanently hiding parts of the UI, Conceal makes them subtle. Action bars, frames, and other interface elements gently fade out during normal gameplay and smoothly reappear when they become relevant — such as when you move your mouse over them, enter combat, or target an enemy.

You decide what gets concealed. Player and target frames, action bars, buffs and debuffs, pet and stance bars, the experience bar, the objective tracker, and more can all be individually configured through an in-game settings menu. Each element can behave differently in and out of combat, allowing you to fine-tune how visible your interface should be at any moment.

Conceal is designed to feel natural and unobtrusive. It does not replace or redesign the Blizzard UI, but works with it by simply reducing visual noise when information is not needed. The result is a cleaner screen, better immersion, and faster access to important information when it matters.

This addon is ideal for players who prefer a minimalist interface, want greater immersion, or simply feel overwhelmed by a constantly visible UI.
